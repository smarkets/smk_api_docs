You'll most probably be calling this more than anything else in this API. In response to this Smarkets will send you one of <a href="#seto/order-accepted" class="type">order-accepted</a>, <a href="#seto/order-rejected" class="type">order-rejected</a>, or <a href="#seto/order-invalid" class="type">order-invalid</a>.

<p>
To prevent your application from accidently creating more orders than it really wanted to you should always locally associate your orders within your application with the <a href="#eto/seq" class="type">seq</a> of the <a href="#eto/payload" class="type">eto/payload</a> you send to Smarkets for the current <a href="#eto/session" class="type">session</a>.

<strong>quantity is *not* stake</strong> - quantity is the sum of both sides of the trade in minor units * 100. For example, a buy order of Â£10 stake at 25% would have quantity of 400000. Which is (1000[minor-units] / 0.25[price]) * 100. The sell trade to fully match this at the same price is exactly the same price and quantity, but with the side field set to buy.

<p>
<strong>reference</strong> is an unsigned 64bit integer that can optionally be set by the client. This reference will be returned to the client in <a href="#seto/order-accepted" class="type">order-accepted</a>, <a href="#seto/order-rejected" class="type">order-rejected</a>, or <a href="#seto/order-invalid" class="type">order-invalid</a>.
